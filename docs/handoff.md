## M1 — 2026-08-22

Built:
- Repo scaffold: `go mod init github.com/magnomp/balancedb` (Go 1.25), `.gitignore`,
  `Makefile` (`lint`, `test`, `itest` [stub until M2], `fmt`, `tools`).
- `internal/config` — parses/validates all `BALANCEDB_*` vars (plan §0 table),
  schema-name regex `^[a-z_][a-z0-9_]{0,62}$`, postgres URL validation, and
  `RedactedDSN()` (password → `xxxxx`) for the startup log. `LoadFrom(getenv)`
  seam keeps tests off the process environment.
- `internal/db` — `Connect()` builds a pgxpool, sets `search_path` per connection
  in `AfterConnect` via `pgx.Identifier{schema}.Sanitize()` (quoted, never
  interpolated), pings on boot with actionable error text. `WithTx()` helper
  (commit on success, rollback on error/panic).
- `cmd/balancedb/main.go` — role dispatch `api|processor|migrate`, slog setup
  (json/text, level from config), `signal.NotifyContext` on SIGTERM/SIGINT,
  graceful shutdown. api/processor boot → hold on ctx → clean exit; migrate is a
  stub (runner is M2).

Decisions: no ADRs. Only dependency added is `jackc/pgx/v5` (already mandated by
plan §0, so no ADR needed). No deviations from spec/plan.

Deferred/known issues:
- `make itest` is a stub — no DB integration tests until the migration/throwaway-
  schema harness lands (M2 + the M10 test-infra note).
- `make lint` is gofumpt-check + `go vet` only. golangci-lint config is planned
  for M13; the CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md sync check is M1.5.
- `search_path` is set to a schema that does not exist until M2 migrations run.
  Postgres accepts this (resolution is lazy); `Ping` does not touch schema
  objects, so boot succeeds against an empty database. Fine as-is.

Notes for next agents (environment):
- **This box had no `go`, `make`, or `gofumpt` preinstalled and no passwordless
  sudo.** I installed Go 1.25 to `$HOME/sdk/go`, `gofumpt` to `$HOME/go/bin`, and
  extracted `make` to `$HOME/bin` (from the `make` .deb). Put these on PATH before
  running the Makefile:
  `export PATH="$HOME/sdk/go/bin:$HOME/go/bin:$HOME/bin:$PATH"`.
  `make tools` installs gofumpt; a similar bootstrap may be needed for other tools.
- A `postgres:18` container `balancedb-pg` is running on `127.0.0.1:5432`
  (db/user/pass all `balancedb`). Manual boot check used:
  `BALANCEDB_DATABASE_URL=postgres://balancedb:balancedb@127.0.0.1:5432/balancedb?sslmode=disable`.
- Gates run green: `make lint`, `make test`. Manual: `migrate`, `api`, `processor`
  all boot, log the redacted startup line, and shut down cleanly.
